# Time_modulation_wave_equation
(1) Compute the effective coefficients with Mathematica: 
    - with 'mathematica_DD_both_zero' for both parameters modulated
    - with 'mathematica_DD_alpha1' for alpha = 1 
    - with 'mathematica_DD_beta1' for beta = 1 
(2) Compute the dispersion relation and related plot with the Matlab file 'dispersion_diagram_homogenized.m'
